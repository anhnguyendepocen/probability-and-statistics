    "## 1. Experiments with One Explanatory Variable\n",
    "A local internet service provider (ISP) created two new versions of its software, with alternative ways of implementing a new feature. To find the product that would lead to the highest satisfaction among customers, the ISP conducted an experiment comparing users' preferences for the two new versions versus the existing software.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ISP ideally wants to find out which of the three software products causes the highest user satisfaction. It has identified three major potential lurking variables that might affect user satisfactionâ€”gender, age, and hours per week of computer use.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, we will use adults in a hypothetical city as the population of interest to the ISP. We will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. create a simple random sample as the basis for the experimental study of the population,\n",
    "2. use randomization to assign individuals to treatment groups, and\n",
    "3. verify that randomization prevented the three treatment groups from being different with respect to the most obvious lurking variables."

    "**Background:** Clinical depression is a recurrent illness requiring treatment and often hospitalization. Nearly 50% of people who have an episode of major depression will have a recurrence within 2-3 years. Being able to prevent the recurrence of depression in people who are at risk for the disease would go a long way to alleviate the pain and suffering of patients and would also save society many thousands of dollars in medical expenses and lost wages due to an inability to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Study:** During the 1980's the federal government, through the National Institutes of Health (NIH), sponsored a multi-centered, randomized, controlled, clinical trial to evaluate two drugs to prevent the recurrence of depression in patients who have had at least one previous episode of the illness (Prien et al., Archives of General Psychiatry, 1984). \n",
    "\n",
    "**The Study Design:** The study was multi-centered. There were 5 medical clinics in major metropolitan areas across the country that participated in this trial. Using many clinics enabled the investigators to enroll many more patients into the study and allowed for more diversity in the patients who participated. There were 3 treatment groups. Patients received either Imipramine (Imip), Lithium (Li), or a Placebo (Pl) where Imip and Li are active drugs. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the 3 treatment groups. Like most other medical studies where new, unexplored treatments are evaluated, patients chose themselves to participate in the study by signing a consent form. Patients were followed for 2-4 years to see whether or not they had a recurrence of depression. If they did not have a recurrence within this time frame, then their treatment was considered a Success. If they did have a recurrence, it was considered a Failure. The study was double-blinded. A number of additional background variables were measured for each patient."

    "**Answer:** The results show that overall, Imipramine is more effective in delaying the recurrence of depression compared to Lithium. It should be noted, however, that the large spread in the distribution of the variable \"Time\" among patients who were treated with Imipramine indicates that being treated with this drug does not guarantee a long delay in the recurrence of depression. In addition, the similarity in the distribution of time until recurrence of depression between the Lithium and Placebo groups suggests that Lithium may not really be an effective treatment for depression."

    "In this exercise we assessed the effectiveness of Lithium and Imipramine as treatments for depression. The two measures of effectiveness were whether or not recurrence of depression occurred, and the time until recurrence of depression. Using both measures we found that Imipramine is more effective than Lithium. More specifically, patients who were treated with Imipramine were less likely to have a recurrence of depression, and if they did, it took longer for recurrence to occur compared to patients who were treated with Lithium.\n",
