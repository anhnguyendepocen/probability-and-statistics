    "## 1. Experiments with One Explanatory Variable\n",
    "A local internet service provider (ISP) created two new versions of its software, with alternative ways of implementing a new feature. To find the product that would lead to the highest satisfaction among customers, the ISP conducted an experiment comparing users' preferences for the two new versions versus the existing software.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ISP ideally wants to find out which of the three software products causes the highest user satisfaction. It has identified three major potential lurking variables that might affect user satisfactionâ€”gender, age, and hours per week of computer use.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, we will use adults in a hypothetical city as the population of interest to the ISP. We will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. create a simple random sample as the basis for the experimental study of the population,\n",
    "2. use randomization to assign individuals to treatment groups, and\n",
    "3. verify that randomization prevented the three treatment groups from being different with respect to the most obvious lurking variables."
