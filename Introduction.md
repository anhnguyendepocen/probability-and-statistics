# Introduction

## The Big Picture
> Statistics is all about converting data into useful information.  

Statistics is a process in which we:
+ Collect Data
+ Summarize Data
+ Interpret Data

Process of statistics starts when we identify a group of objects we want to study which is called the **Population**. For example
+ Public opinion on death penalty
+ How population of mice react to a certain chemical
+ Average price of an apartment with 1 bedroom in Mumbai

Full Population is very large and is almost impossible to study all of it. More practical way is to collect data and examine only a subgroup of the population called a **Sample**. This 1<sup>st</sup> step of choosing a sample from population and collecting data from it is called **Producing Data**.

Since, for practical reasons, we examing only a subgroup of population instead of while population, we should take special care in choosing a sample. Sample should be such that it represents the population well.

Once data is collected, we need to summarize it in a meaningful way. This 2<sup>nd</sup> step is called **Exploratory Data Analysis**.

Now, once we are done with smapling data and summarizing it, we need to study it as we want to be able to draw some conculsions about the population from the sample. But before we can start with this, we need to check how the sample is different from the population as whole. To examine this, we use **Probability**.

In essence, probability is the "machinery" that allows us to draw conclusion about the population from sampled data

Finally, we can use what we've discovered to draw conclusions. This final step is called **Infernece**.

### *Example*:

At the end of April 2005, a poll was conducted (by ABC News and the Washington Post) for the purpose of learning the opinions of U.S. adults about the death penalty.

1. *Producing Data:* A (representative) sample of 1,082 U.S. adults was chosen, and each adult was asked whether he or she favored or opposed the death penalty.

2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):* The collected data were summarized, and it was found that 65% of the sampled adults favor the death penalty for persons convicted of murder.

3. *Probability* and 4. *Inference*: Based on the sample result (of 65% favoring the death penalty) and our knowledge of probability, it was concluded (with 95% confidence) that the percentage of those who favor the death penalty in the population is within 3% of what was obtained in the sample (i.e., between 62% and 68%). The following figure summarizes the example:
