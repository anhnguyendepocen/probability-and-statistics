# Producing Data: Designing Studies

Production of data happens in two stages: **sampling** and **study design**.

Our goal in sampling is to get a sample that represents the population of interest well, so that when we get to the inference stage, making conclusions based on this sample about the entire population will make sense. We discussed several biased sampling plans, but also introduced the "family" of probability sampling plans, the simplest of which is the simple random sample, that (at least in theory) are supposed to provide a sample that is not subject to any biases.

In the section on study design, we introduced 3 types of design: **observational study**, **controlled experiment**, and **sample survey**.

1. **Observational studies:**

    - The explanatory variable's values are allowed to occur naturally.

    - Because of the possibility of lurking variables, it is difficult to establish causation.

    - If possible, control for suspected lurking variables by studying groups of similar individuals separately.

    - Some lurking variables are difficult to control for; others may not be identified.

2. **Experiments:**

    * The explanatory variable's values are controlled by researchers (treatment is imposed).

    * Randomized assignment to treatments automatically controls for all lurking variables.

    * Making subjects blind avoids the placebo effect.

    * Making researchers blind avoids conscious or subconscious influences on their subjective assessment of responses.

    * A randomized controlled double-blind experiment is generally optimal for establishing causation.

    * A lack of realism may prevent researchers from generalizing experimental results to real-life situations.

    * Noncompliance may undermine an experiment. A volunteer sample might solve (at least partially) this problem.

    * It is impossible, impractical or unethical to impose some treatments.  


We saw that with observational studies it is **difficult** to establish **convincing evidence of a causal relationship**, because of **lack of control** over outside variables (called **lurking variables**). Other pitfalls that may arise are that individuals' behaviors may be affected if they know they are participating in an observational study, and that individuals' memories may be faulty if they are asked to recall information from the past.

Experiments allow researchers to take **control of lurking variables** by **randomized assignment to treatments**, which helps provide more convincing evidence of causation. The design may be enhanced by making sure that subjects and/or researchers are **blind** to who receives **what treatment**. Depending on what relationship is being researched, it may be difficult to design an experiment whose setting is realistic enough that we can safely generalize the conclusions to real life.

Another reason that **observational studies** are utilized rather than **experiments** is that certain **explanatory variables**—such as income or alcohol intake—either **cannot** or **should not** be **controlled** by **researchers**.

Sample surveys are occasionally used to examine relationships, but often they assess values of many separate variables, such as respondents' opinions on various matters. Survey questions should be designed carefully, in order to ensure unbiased assessment of the variables' values.

Throughout this section, we established guidelines for the ideal production of data, which should be held as standards to strive for. Realistically, however, it is rarely possible to carry out a study which is completely free of flaws. Therefore, common sense must frequently be applied in order to decide which imperfections we can live with, and which ones could completely undermine a study's results.
