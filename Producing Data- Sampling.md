# Producing Data: Sampling

Our goal, in statistics, is to use information from a sample to draw conclusions about the larger group, called the population. The first step in this process is to obtain a sample of individuals that are truly representative of the population. If this step is not carried out properly, then the sample is subject to bias, a systematic tendency to misrepresent the variables of interest in the population.

**Bias** is almost **guaranteed** if a **volunteer sample** is used. If the individuals select themselves for the study, they are often different in an important way from the individuals who did not volunteer. 

A **convenience sample**, chosen because individuals were in the right place at the right time to suit the researcher, may be different from the general population in a subtle but important way. However, for certain variables of interest, a convenience sample may still be fairly representative. 

The **sampling frame** of individuals from whom the sample is actually selected should match the population of interest; *bias may result if parts of the population are systematically excluded*.

**Systematic sampling** takes an organized (but **not random**) approach to the selection process, as in picking every 50th name on a list, or the first product to come off the production line each hour. Just as with convenience sampling, there may be **subtle sources** of **bias** in such a plan, or it may be adequate for the purpose at hand. Most studies are subject to some degree of **nonresponse**, referring to individuals who do not go along with the researchers' intention to include them in a study. If there are too many nonrespondents, and they are different from respondents in an important way, then the sample turns out to be biased.

In general, bias may be **eliminated (in theory)**, or at least **reduced (in practice)**, if researchers do their best to implement a **probability sampling plan** that utilizes **randomness**. 

The most **basic** probability sampling plan is a **simple random sample**, where every group of individuals has the same chance of being selected as every other group of the same size. This is achieved by **sampling at random** and without replacement. 

In a **cluster sample**, groups of individuals are randomly selected, such as all people in the same household. In a cluster sample, all members of each selected group participate in the study. 

A **stratified sample** divides the population into groups called strata before selecting study participants at random from within those groups. 

**Multistage sampling** makes the sampling process more manageable by working down from a large population to successively smaller groups within the population, taking advantage of stratifying along the way, and sometimes finishing up with a cluster sample or a simple random sample.

Assuming the various sources of bias have been avoided, researchers can learn more about the variables of interest for the population by taking larger samples. The "extreme" (meaning, the largest possible sample) would be to study every single individual in the population (the goal of a census), but in practice, such a design is rarely feasible. Instead, researchers must try to obtain the largest sample that fits in their budget (in terms of both time and money), and must take great care that the sample is truly representative of the population of interest.
